Restrict , hide , or block the content of your WordPress posts using a conditional rules system.

== Description ==
This plugin is the perfect tool to restrict , hide , or block  content from unwanted users.

You can use an advanced conditions system to control who can read your blog posts.

**This plugin works with WPML automatically.**

= How does it work? =

You go to our settings page and select the post types, and you can select the condition rules to allow or disallow the content of those posts.
You can create AND and OR groups for advanced restrictions.

When the user is allowed to read the content, the post will load as usual.
When the user is not allowed to read the post content, you have the option to show an excerpt + a custom message, just a custom message, or redirect the post to another URL.

= Is this bad for SEO? =

No. Our restrictions don't apply for bots like Google, Bing, etc. They see the full post.
We apply the restrictions to regular users only.


= Examples =

You can use this for a lot of purposes.

* Restrict post based on URL parameters

* Restrict the post content for all the posts containing a keyword in the URL
